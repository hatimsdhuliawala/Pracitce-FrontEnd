Create a folder and create a file with name styles.scss

sass 
	-- cannot be understood by the browser
	-- sass code has to be convereted to css code for browser to understand

How can we convert sass code into css code?

sass --watch inputFileName:OutputFileName

sass --watch styles.scss:styles.css 

a new file will be created with name styles.css

--watch will look for changes in the file of scss and converts every time to css files. 

css preprocessors 

LESS, SASS, Stylus

they have to be converted from sass to css

why to use SASS?
	--> Maintainability
