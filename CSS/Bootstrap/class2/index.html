While most text-to-speech systems analyze and synthesize text one sentence at a time, OS X analyzes text a paragraph at a time to decipher the context of words more accurately. This helps Alex more closely match the nuances of how people really talk. He sounds so natural, he even pauses for a breath between long passages. So when Alex reads longer passages in books, articles, and news stories, you understand them more easily.GesturesYou can control VoiceOver using many of the same gestures you use on iOS. Touch the trackpad to hear a description of the item under your finger, drag to hear items continuously, and flick to move to the next item. Enable the VoiceOver Trackpad Commander, and the trackpad surface will represent the current window or document, so you can navigate quickly to any corner or edge with a tap. Using VoiceOver with gestures, you get a clear sense of how items are arranged on the screen.</div>
