while(condition) {
	//stmts
}

untill the condition is true the stmts keep on executed 
if the contion fails then it will stop executing stmts

var i = 0;
while(i<10) {
	console.log(i);
	i++;
}

do{
	stmts;
}while(condition)

diff between do while loop and while loop

--> the first it executes the statments and then it starts checking for condition from second time

var i =0; 
do{
	console.log(i);
	i++;
}while(i<10);

for (initialization (1); condition (2)(5)..; increment (4)(7)) {
	stmts(3)(6);
}

function func1() {
	console.log('function executed');
}


function overloading 

func1(2,3);
