Closures -- within a function, you have access to its parent variables and function, you have access to any thing in global scope it would available. varaibles and functions you define as a part of function will not available outside.

iife -- imediately invoked function execution
		-- without invoking it will be executed the syntax of iife is 
			(function(){
				// have the logic here
			})();
		-- why to use an iife
			-- they cant be called again
			-- they create a name space-- 


Hoisting -- all the declaration will be moved to the top.
		-- intialization will not be moved to the top.


var a=6;

var a; // declaration
a=6; // intialization
