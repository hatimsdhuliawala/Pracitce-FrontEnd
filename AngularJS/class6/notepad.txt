If i have a model within a template

if you are using shared scope

if i change model is one directive instance it changes all the directives model.


default would be shared scope 

if you want to make the directive instance model independent the use isolate scope 


scope : {}


@ = &

When in isolate scope if you want receive information through the attribute of the directive you 


@ --> reading information from the attribute

= --> reading the model from the attribute and putting in the template

& --> reading the reference of a function from the parent scope

link -- 

	scope -- access to scope
	element -- dom manuplation or event handler operation can be done using element
	attrs -- reading info in attributes
