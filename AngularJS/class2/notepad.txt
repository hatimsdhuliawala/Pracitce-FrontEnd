$scope is reference object in order to access the model in  controller

$rootscope --> any model defined outside the controllers. 
				This would available through out the entire angular application

what if you have to define a model outside of a controller --> $rootScope

defining actions can also be on a controller?

We can define methods on $scope.eat = function() {alert('eating food!!')};

this methods can be invoked from ng-click="methodName()"



Model is looked on current scope then if not found its parent scope, if not found rootscope if not found empty.
