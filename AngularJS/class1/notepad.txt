Angular


Step 1 : Downloading and including angular JS 

	CDN 

Step 2 : ng-app attribute

MV

M - model -- hold the data
V - View -- representing the model on the html

<input ng-model="firstName">

here input is in view 

any thing you change as a part of view will be updated in the model

ng-model

All the changes done in the <input ng-model="firstName"> are observed and updated in the model with name "firstName"

ng-bind 

Any changes in the model will be observed and updated as a part of the html

 
ng-model 
view --> model

ng-bind
model --> view


Two Data binding

view <--> model

there would a continous synchronization of data in between view and model

https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding

MVVM -- model view Viewmodel

view model --> synchrnoized the data in between model and view.


ng-app -- only this element will be considered as an angular application

if ng-app="someName"

The appliction name has to be registered

angular.module('myApp',[]);

instead of ng-bind we can use {{modelName}}


MVC 

Controller --
	--> We can create a child scope using a controller
		any model you define in controller is only valid in that controller --> not anywhere outside
	--> actions can be defined as a part of controller
