AJAX -- Aynchrnous Java Script and XML

On the server side 

we have webservices (REST)

REST API
REST Web services
Web services 

Using AJAX we can make a call to REST Web service and get information and show it on the server.


Client -- AJAX
Server -- REST 


Server (REST) -- listenes to the request and respond

client (AJAX) -- will send the request, waits for the response and process the response.

You need URL to make a AJAX call.

HTTP methods 

GET -- retrieve information

POST -- create new records

PUT -- update the records

DELETE -- remove records
